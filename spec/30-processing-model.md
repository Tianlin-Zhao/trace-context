# Processing Model

This section describes the behavior of a tracing system when a new request is received.
As stated above, tracing systems can decide for each request whether they want to
just _forward_ or _participate_ in a trace context. Additionally, when participating,
a system needs to be able to start or restart a trace.

## Processing Model in Forwarding Mode

In forwarding mode, a tracing system decides to forward tracing information
but does not modify the trace-context headers.

1. The tracing system receives a `traceparent` header and may receive a `tracecontext`.
2. The tracing system tries to parse the version of the `traceparent` header.
   - If the version prefix cannot be parsed (it's not 2 hex characters followed by
  a dash (`-`)), the implementation should restart the trace.
    > **PENDING DECISION**: If a system is in forwarding only mode. It cannot
    start a trace. (Issue: https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/issues/220)

   - If the version is higher than supported by the tracing
   system, it does no further validations.

3. If the tracing system supports the version number, it validates `trace-id`
   and `parent-id`.
   - If `trace-id` and `parent-id` are valid, the tracing system adds the entire
     `trace-context` to all outgoing request originating from the current
     incoming request.
   - If either `trace-id` or `parent-id` is invalid, the tracing system does not
     add the trace context to any outgoing requests.
    > **PENDING DECISION**: We never explicitly defined this, but I think this
    is what should happen. (Issue: https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/issues/220)

## Processing Model in Participation Mode

In participation mode, the tracing system decides to forward **and** modify
tracecontext headers. The request is then considered as sampled.

1. The tracing system receives a `traceparent` header and may receive `tracecontext`.
2. The tracing system tries to parse the version of the `traceparent` header.
   - If the version prefix cannot be parsed (it's not 2 hex characters followed
  by a dash (`-`)), the tracing system creates a new `traceparent` header and
  removes all entries from `tracecontext`.
   - If the version number is higher than supported by the tracing implementation,
  the implementation uses the format defined in this specification to parse
  `trace-id` and `parent-id`. The tracing system will only parse `flags` values
  supported by the current version of this specification and ignore all other
  values. If parsing fails, the tracing system creates a new `traceparent` header
  and removes all entries from `tracecontext`.

3. When the tracing system supports the version number it validates `trace-id`
and `parent-id`.
   - If either `trace-id`, `parent-id` or `flags`  are invalid,  the tracing
  system creates a new `traceparent` header and removes all entries from `tracecontext`.
4. After the system has validated the traceparent, it validates the tracestate.
    > **PENDING DECISION**: How do we do this exactly?

5. The tracing system modifies the `traceparent` header.
    - **Update `parent-id`**. The value of property `parent-id` can be set to
    the new value representing the ID of the current operation. This is the most
    common mutation and should be considered a default.
    > **PENDING DECISION**: This definition is not entirely clear.
    - **Indicate recorded state**. The value of `recorded` flag of `trace-flags`
    may be set to `1` if it had the value `0` before or vice versa. `parent-id`
    MUST be set to the new value with the `recorded` flag updated.
    See details of `recorded` flag for more information on how this flag is
    recommended to be used.
    - **Update `recorded`**. The value of `recorded` reflects the callers
    recording behavior: either the trace data were dropped or may have been
    recorded out-of-band. This mutation gives the downstream tracer information
    about the likelihood its parent's information was recorded.
6. Tracing System modifies the `tracestate` header
    - **Update key value**. The value of any key can be updated. Modified keys
    MUST be moved to the beginning of the list. This is the most common mutation
    resuming the trace.
    - **Add new key-value pair**. The new key-value pair should be added into
    the beginning of the list.
    - **Delete the key-value pair**. Any key-value pair MAY be deleted. It is
    highly discouraged to delete keys that weren't generated by the same tracing
    system or platform. Deletion of an unknown key-value pair will break
    correlation in other systems. This mutation enables two scenarios:
      - Proxies can block specific `tracestate` keys for privacy and security
    concerns.
      - Truncation of long `tracestate` entries.

## Processing Model for starting or restarting a trace

The process for starting a new trace and restarting an existing trace are similar.
Restarting a trace is highly discouraged as it breaks end-to-end visibility.

Possible reasons for _restarting_ a trace are:

- Crossing of a trust boundary
- Receiving an invalid traceparent header

1. **Generating the traceparent header:**

   All properties - `trace-id`, `parent-id`, `trace-flags`
   are generated.

2. **Generating the tracestate header:**

   A new key-value pair can be added to the empty list.
