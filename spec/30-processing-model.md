# Processing Model

This section provides a step-by-step description of the behavior of a tracing implementation - also called tracer -  when a request is received. This description can be used as a reference when implementing a Trace Context compliant tracing system, middleware or cloud service.

## Processing Model for Working with Trace Context

The processing model describes the behavior of a tracer which forwards **and** modifies
Trace Context headers.

1. The tracer receives a `traceparent` header and may receive a `tracestate` header.
2. The tracer tries to parse the version of the `traceparent` header.
   - If the version prefix cannot be parsed, the tracer creates a new `traceparent`
     header and removes all entries from `tracestate`.
   - If the version number is higher than supported by the tracer,
  the implementation uses the format defined in this specification to parse
  `trace-id` and `parent-id`. The tracer will only parse `trace-flags` values
  supported by the current version of this specification and ignore all other
  values. If parsing fails, the tracing system creates a new `traceparent` header
  and removes all entries from `tracestate`.

3. If the tracer supports the version number, it validates `trace-id`
  and `parent-id`.
   - If either `trace-id`, `parent-id` or `flags`  are invalid,  the tracer
   creates a new `traceparent` header and removes all entries from `tracestate`.

4. The tracer validates the `tracestate` header. If the `tracestate` header cannot be parsed the system creates a new empty `tracestate` header.

5. For each outgoing request the tracer performs the following steps:

   - The tracing system MUST modify the `traceparent` header.
        - **Update `parent-id`**. The value of property `parent-id` MUST be set to        the a value representing the ID of the current operation.
        -  **Update `recorded`**. The value of `recorded` reflects the callers
            recording behavior. The value of the `recorded` flag of `trace-flags`
            MAY be set to `1` if the trace data is likely to be recorded or to `0` otherwise. Setting the flag is no guarantee that the trace will be recorded but increases the likeliness of end-to-end recorded traces.
    - The tracer modifies the `tracestate` header
        - **Update key value**. The value of any key can be updated. Modified keys
        MUST be moved to the beginning of the list. 
        - **Add new key-value pair**. The new key-value pair should be added into
        the beginning of the list.
        - **Delete the key-value pair**. Any key-value pair MAY be deleted. It is
        highly discouraged to delete keys that weren't generated by the same tracing
        system or platform. Deletion of an unknown key-value pair will break
        correlation in other systems. This mutation enables two scenarios:
            - Proxies can block specific `tracestate` keys for privacy and security
            concerns.
            - Truncation of long `tracestate` entries.
    - The tracer set the `traceparent` and `tracestate` header for the outgoing request


## Alternative Processing

The processing model above described the complete set of steps for processing tracecontext headers. There are, however, situation when an implementation only supports a subset of the steps described above. Proxies or messaging middleware MAY not modify the `traceparent` headers but may remove invalid headers or add additional information to `tracestate`.
